	<p>
	Hello, my name is Debby Chiu. I was born in Canada on November 17th, 1995.<br>
	I decided to pursue a career in computing because I was always intrigued by technology and my uncle also graduated from CST.<br>	
	I like to play games, listen to music, and hang out with friends. My favorite programming languages are Java and Python because I first learned<br>
	programming through Java, and Python - to me - is a superior Java in terms of how much more convenient everything is thus far.<br>
	<br>
